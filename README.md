Bullet Blitz
============

Overview
--------

Bullet Blitz is a fast-paced first-person shooter game where players must fight their way through waves of enemies in multiple levels. Each level presents a unique environment and set of challenges, from deserts to urban areas. Players must strategically use their weapons and abilities to take down the enemies, and they can upgrade their weapons and abilities between levels.

Objective
---------

The objective of Bullet Blitz is to progress through each level by defeating all of the enemies in each wave. Players must survive against increasingly difficult enemy waves, and they can earn points for every enemy they defeat. The ultimate goal is to achieve the highest score possible and complete all levels.

Gameplay
--------

Players control a character armed with a gun that fires projectiles. The gun has unlimited ammo, but it requires time to reload after each shot. In addition to the gun, players have access to three abilities:

1.  Stone ability (Q key): This ability is effective against paper-type enemies.
2.  Paper ability (E key): This ability is effective against scissors-type enemies.
3.  Scissors ability (X key): This ability is effective against stone-type enemies.

Each ability has a cooldown period, which prevents players from spamming them repeatedly. Players must use their abilities strategically, as different enemies are vulnerable to different abilities based on a rock-paper-scissors type system. The enemies also have different movement patterns and attack styles, so players must be mindful of their positioning and use cover to avoid taking damage.

Between levels, players can upgrade their abilities and weapons using points earned from defeating enemies. They can also purchase new weapons and ammo, as well as health packs and other items to aid them in combat.

Bullet Blitz features a leaderboard that displays the top scores for each level, encouraging players to try again and beat their high score with each new run.
